# Visualising Pharmacy Locations with R

*This is a side-project where new information will be continuously added* 

The motivation behind this project is that I wanted to visualise how competitive is in the retail pharmacy sector, especially in Penang. 

This project utilises open-source data published on the *Official Portal of Pharmaceutical Services Programme Register of Licenses*, available [here](https://www.pharmacy.gov.my/v2/en/information/register-licences.html).

# Data Collection 

Information of all registered pharmacies (retail or wholesale) is manually collected from the website, filtering for License A (pharmacist license) in Penang state only. A total of 602 entries were collected. Among the important variables that I needed were (1) Name of the premise, (2) Address, and (3) Type of the business (retail, wholesale, or both).  

As the file size is quite small, the `.csv`{.R} sheet is read via the `read.csv()`{.R} wrapper function. The data frame is given a name "PG" via

```{r data, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
PG <- read.csv("PGpharm.csv")
```

Displaying the column names suggests that the information is sufficient for what I want to do here. (Note: the column names were written in Malay where 'Nama.Premis'='Premise Name' and 'Alamat.Premis'='Premise Address') 

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
colnames(PG)
```

Since the data is published by an official government portal, there should be no missing data but it doesn't hurt to check. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
which(is.na(PG$Nama.Premis))
which(is.na(PG$Alamat.Premis))
```

Once data completeness has been confirmed, I can move on to prepare the data for mapping. 

# GIS package in R 

I am mainly using the `mapview()`{.R} [package](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/) and `ggmap()` [package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggmap/versions/2.6.1)

The first step is to convert the the address to latitude and longtidue. This is done by using the `geocode()` function. 

Note that geocoding requires tools that may not be free. Most notably is the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started) that requires an account on the Google Cloud Platform in order to work. I am using a mixed of the public API by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/4.116/109.455) called [Nominatim](http://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/api/Overview/) and Google Maps API. 

The following codes are used to convert addresses to latitude and longitude. I used `cascade_oder=c("osm","google")` to order first geocoding services with Nominatim followed by Google Maps service.  

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE,tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
library(ggmap)

lat_longs3 <- PG %>%
  geocode(PG$Alamat.Premis, method="cascade", cascade_order=c("osm","google"), lat=latitude, long=longitude)
```

Sometimes the geocoding process will fail to produce any coordinates and subsequent mapping cannot proceed. In this case, the coordinates will be manually identified and filled. 

# Mapping pharmacies 

As the coordinates of the pharmacies are complete now, I can proceed to map their locations for subsequent analysis. 

```{r, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
lat_longs3<-read.csv("penang.csv")
```

The next step is to convert the coordinates into sf objects with `st_as_sf()` command (of the `sf()` package)

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(sf)

pg_sf <- st_as_sf(lat_longs3, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs=4326)
```

To map these pharmacies, the package `mapview()` will be needed. I opted to use the colour palette from the package `RColorBrewer`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
library(mapview)
library(RColorBrewer)

pg_pharm <-mapview(pg_sf, zcol=c("Nama.Premis"), legend=FALSE, layer.name = "Retail & Wholesale Pharmacies in Penang")
```

The distribution of all retail & wholesale pharmacies in Penang state is shown below. Each colour dot represents a pharmacy. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
pg_pharm

```
