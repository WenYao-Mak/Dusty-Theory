# Why `.tabset` and why it fails? 

Interactive articles are more powerful to convey information to readers. Better visualisation helps readers to digest the content faster. 

It is easy to include tabs in `html` article. The `.tabset` function can be included at a heading (say level 2) and all the following subheading (i.e. level 3) will be arranged in tabbed panels. However, this approach **does not work with distill**. This is confirmed in a 2018 post [here](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/11) but the authors did mention they wish to use [jqueryUI tabsets](https://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/) in the future. 

*Note: This information is accurate as of 17th January 2022*

# Workaround 

[**Garrik Aden-Buie**](https://github.com/gadenbuie) suggested the `panelset` function from `xaringanExtra` to circumvent this issue, but the approach requires the fenced-div syntax as followed: 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, class.source = 'fold-show'}
xaringanExtra::use_panelset()

# ::::: {.panelset}
#
# ::: {.panel}
#
# # Tab One {.panel-name}
#
# Content for tab one here
# 
# ### Sub heading one
#
# **Psst: see tab two!** 
#
# :::
#
# ::: {.panel}
#
# ## Tab Two {.panel-name}
#
# This is how I feel when I try to code

#
# :::
#
# ::: {.panel}
#
# ## Tab Three {.panel-name}
#
# Content for tab three here
#
# :::
#
# :::::
```

## End results

The end results look like this: 

::::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}

## Tab One {.panel-name}

Content for tab one here

### Sub heading one

**Psst: see tab two!** 

:::

::: {.panel}

## Tab Two {.panel-name}


This is how I feel when I try to code
