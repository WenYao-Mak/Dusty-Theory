This is represented by the survivor function S(t), as below:\r\n\\[S(t)=Pr(T>t)\\] The function indicates the population probability of surviving beyond time t.\r\nGraphical representation of the survival function\r\nThe survival function can be depicted as a survival curve. This is more intuitive to understand the probability of surviving (or in our case, remain peritonitis-free) beyond a certain time t.\r\n\r\nCall: survfit(formula = Surv(time, event) ~ sex, data = kaplan)\r\n\r\n       n events median 0.95LCL 0.95UCL\r\nsex=1 10      3    493     254      NA\r\nsex=2 10      1     NA      NA      NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
